To run locally :
```
npm i
npm start
```

Note : I used [ImgFlip API](https://imgflip.com/api) to both extract all the memes and save memes. So there might be some memes that needed more that two text fields (like the first meme) which may cause errors on saving. I do not create my own backend here. Also once you save the meme you might get a meme with text at unexpected places since it depend on the ImgFlip API.
